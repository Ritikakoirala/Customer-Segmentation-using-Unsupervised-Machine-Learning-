# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics such as income, spending behavior, and purchasing patterns.  
This project applies **Unsupervised Machine Learning** using **KMeans Clustering** to segment customers for better marketing strategies and business decision-making.

The implementation is inspired by a **GeeksforGeeks tutorial** and uses a **real-world e-commerce dataset** to demonstrate practical clustering techniques in Python.

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer-related attributes such as:
- Customer ID  
- Annual Income  
- Spending Score  
- Purchase-related metrics  

> *Dataset represents real-world e-commerce customer behavior.*

## 📈 Visualizations
- Elbow Method graph to identify optimal `k`
- 2D scatter plots for customer clusters
- Color-coded segmentation for easy interpretation



## 💡 Key Insights
- Customers can be grouped into distinct segments based on income and spending
- High-income, high-spending customers are ideal targets for premium marketing
- Low-spending segments require different engagement strategies
